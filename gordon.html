      <p> Gordon Hayward, professional basketball player for the Utah Jazz, would like to address the social stigma attached to video games and the people who play them.</p>
      <p> As with many people, video games give Hayward an opportunity to relax and have some fun. <span class="quote2">"Video games have always been an escape. They’re something I associate with relaxation. And if nothing else, they’re really, really, really fun".</span> But again as with many people, video games also fulfill something more than just relaxtion and fun for Hayward: his competitive spirit. As a child, video games gave him a way to feel that competitive drive while still hanging out with his friends and being a kid.
      <p> Despite the fast-paced growth of the video game industry, people who play video games still have not been able to escape the stereotypes associated with video games. With the emergence of online gaming, people are spending more time gaming as the industry has arguably become more competitive than ever, only worsening the stereotyping. </p>
      <p> <span class="quote"> "There’s a bizarre logic that if you’re willing to put in the time to become good at a video game, you won’t be willing to put in the time to become good at anything else." </span> </p>
      <p> Gordon is proof that this certainly is not the case. In Gordon's mind, video games has actually benefitted his other pursuits in life. </p>
      <p> Gordon argues that "professional" gamers spend just as much time honing their skills as professional athletes. It's no longer just about having fun with friends. Gaming has become a popular spectator sport as video game competitions have accumulated mass followings. Prize pools for these competitions can reach millions. Gamers in certain countries have begun to reach celebrity status. </p>
      <p> Gordon is not trying to defend video games. To him, it does not defending. <span class="quote2">"I just want non-gamers to recognize this incredible thing that’s happening right now. Video game culture has now gone mainstream — and we’re only scratching the surface." </span> According to Hayward, more of us having a competitive gaming spirit in us than we might realize, and that is nothing to be ashamed of.  </p>
