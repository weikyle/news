        <p> Williams was selected by the Chicago Bulls with the second overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft. He had a very long and promising career, but his aspirtations were quickly crushed after a career-ending motorcycle accident. </p>

        <p>Less than a year after being drafted, Williams was involved in a motorcycle accident that left him with a severed main nerve in his leg, a fractured pelvis, and three dislocated ligaments in his left knee, including the ACL. He had to undergo physical therapy to regain the use of his leg. He was waived by the Bulls and after making an attempt at a comeback a few years later, he finally decided to end his career for good. </p>
        
         <p> <span class="quote"> "Players are going to find some way to deal with the pain..." </span> </p>

        <p> Medicinal drug use is consistently a controversial topic, especially when it comes to professional athletes. Williams believes there to be a double standard exists when it comes to this topic. He argues that players are prescribed numerous drugs to cope with pain and stress that they could potentially become dependent upon, yet the use of marijuana is still banned by the league. According to Williams, marijuana has multiple benefits including reducing joint and muscleinflammation as well as anxiety. </p>

        <p> <span class="quote"> "We're in a situation where there is a double standard. I think that these private institutions are demonizing a drug that socially is becoming way more acceptable." </span> </p>

        <p> Williams believes that the world is progressing as states and countries are beginning to legalize use of certain drugs, yet certain private institutions remain archaic in their thinking. He argues that a great deal of professional athletes will find ways to cope with their pain, leading many of them to turn to drug use. </p>

        <p> Williams now works as a broadcast analyst for both collegiate and professional basketball. </p>
