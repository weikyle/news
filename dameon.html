      <section class="article">
      <p> Modern basketball in the NBA has seen a shift towards the "small-ball" game. No longer does a team require a dominant big man to be considered a championship contender. The last true center to win Finals MVP was Shaquille O’Neal back in 2002. O'Neal was also the last regular season MVP who played center back in the 1999-00 season. The slower paced, mismatch-oriented, inside-out game we're familiar with from the previous decades has become somewhat of an archaic playstyle. Instead, we are seeing the rise of uptempo, faster line-ups that rely more heavily on speed, athleticism, and the ability to move the ball and shoot from outside. This plays exactly into the strength of guards. Therefore, it is no surprise that we are seeing guards beginning to take over the game.</p>
      <p>Jameer Nelson is a point guard who has been around in the league for 11 years, allowing him to witness this trend first-hand. He understands the reason for the trend and sees no problem with it.</p>
      <p> <span class="quote"> "I honestly believe the rise of elite guard play is a good thing for both the league and the fans. Guards make the game more exciting. We are the ones taking control of the game, determining the pace and making the most significant decisions on the floor." </span> </p>

      <p>Guards are no longer solely just facilitators for their teammates. Now more than ever, guards have become legitimate scoring threats. Players like Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry, and Russell Westbrook are proof that even point guards are not the one dimensional distributors that the league had been used to seeing for so long. The aggressive playstyle we are seeing from guards have added an entirely new facet to the game.</p>
      <p>But with the growth of the scoring guard, we are also seeing a growth in the talent pool. With the emergence of these two trends, Nelson warns future guards that they must be especially prepared if they want to make it in the league.</p>
      <p> <span class="quote"> " It’s crowded for guards these days. My advice for talented young point guards entering the league is: Come prepared. You’re now stepping into a league that’s more of a grind than ever. " </span> </p>

      <p> After more than a decade in the league, Nelson has transitioned into a veteran leadership position on his team. He relies on his physical strength, experience, and knowledge of the game to stay competitive amongst the younger, faster, and more athletic guards. However, he is excited to see the new direction the league is heading in as guards begin to take charge. </p>
