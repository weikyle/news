        <p> DeAndre Jordan was considered one of the biggest and most sought after free agents available during the summer of 2015. He holds a reputation as an athletic freak of nature, a ravenous rebounder, and an emphatic shot blocker. Thus, Dallas Mavericks supporters were ecstatic when they learned that he had made a verbal commitment to come to Dallas. However, just days later, Jordan went back on his agreement with the Mavericks and decided to re-sign with the Los Angeles Clippers, leaving the Mavs fanbase and organization angry and confused. Fans and media alike were anxious to hear his reasoning for doing so, and Jordan has decided to speak out. </p>

        <p> Jordan states that his reason for initially agreeing to join the Mavericks was for a change of scenary. As Jordan puts it, <span class="quote2"> "I thought I wanted change. I thought I needed change at that point in time." </span> The organization itself appeared greatly to Jordan as well, with a good coach and owner, a strong roster, and a recent NBA championship under their belt. But unfortunately, after making with the agreement with Dallas, he began to realize that he hadn't give the decision all of his thought.</p>

        
         <p> <span class="quote"> "At the end of the day we're basketball players and these great athletes, but we're also human and we make mistakes and we have emotions and feelings just like everybody else." </span></p>

         <p> There is not a single reason that we can point to for the decision he made, but rather a combination of several reasons that, together, made Jordan believe staying in Los Angeles was the right decision, even if it meant upsetting an entire fanbase. His response to the situation came with much criticism not only from the Mavericks fanbase, but also from other NBA supporters and especially the media. </p>

         <p> <span class="quote"> "I decided to stay with the Clippers because I have been with this team for seven years, and being with one team for my entire career is definintely important to me." </span></p>

         <p> Within those several years, Jordan has been able to witness the team grow immensely. At only 19 years old in his rookie season with the Clippers, Jordan was a part of a Clippers team that finished with a 19-63 record. Since then, after a few major personnel acquisitions, the Clippers have become a consistent championship contender over the last few years. Jordan plans to continue growing with this team in the hopes that he can look back and say that he made the right decision to stay in Los Angeles as they hoist up the championship trophy. </p>
