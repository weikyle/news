        <p> Larry Sanders, former player for the Milwaukee Bucks, discusses why he decided to quit the NBA. </p>
      <p>The then-26 year old walked away from millions and, what many people would describe as, a "dream job" in December of 2014 when the NBA season was getting into full swing. To no one's surprise, fans and media quickly questioned the reasons behind his mysterious and sudden disappearance. Sanders hopes to finally answer these questions. </p>
      <p> <span class="quote"> "I actually entered into Rogers Memorial Hospital and it was a program for anxiety and depression, mood disorders." </span> </p>
      <p>In his mind, the time he needed to devote to his job as a professional basketball player was not worth sacrificing the other aspects of his life- his family, friends, personal interests- and his mental stability and happiness began to suffer because of it.  </p>
      <p> A major point that Larry Sanders wants people to remember is to be wary of assigning labels to people. There are many more dimenions to every individual than these labels will lead us to believe. <span class="quote2"> "Dont neglect the 'and..', that's what I always say. Don't neglect the 'and...'. You say I'm selfish, <b>and</b> I'm loving, <b>and</b> I'm caring, <b>and</b> I'm fearful sometimes. <b>And</b> I'm also brave. We are all more than just one thing."</span> People question how he cannot be happy with such a high paying, prolific job. But to Sanders, his happiness is not fueled by monetary wealth. Just because he is a professional basketball player, that does not mean his profession is his primary source of happiness. Individual happiness is definied within and is different for every person. Sanders' personal happiness comes from his closest loved ones and a sound mind. As Sanders argues, our ability to get though each day is heavily dependent on our mental health, and that is a part of us that we cannot forget to cater to.</p>

      <p>He is devoting his energy to spending time with friends and family, exploring personal interests such as music, and generally engaging in more positive pursuits. If and when he feels ready, he will consider a return to the NBA.</p>
