      <p> With his heavily tattooed body and his cornrows hairstyle, Allen Iverson was aware of the negative persona that was placed upon him for his image. To him, it was nothing. To some others, it made him a thug. </p>
      <p> <span class="quote"> "I always was basically judged from day one. With the tattoos- I basically got one and then got addicted to it. I just kept getting more. All of my tattoos that I have mean something. I have my kids' names on my body, I have my mom's name on my body- it's a bad thing?" </span> </p>

      <p>Iverson also addressed the topic of his iconic, yet somewhat infamous hairstyle. <span class="quote2"> "With my hair in cornrows, people talk about it being a thug thing. I was tired of barbers messing up my hair, and I was like, 'If I grow out my hair and get cornrows then I don't have to deal with that anymore'. And I had cornows and they turned that into some thug thing. I don't know, I guess it was just an Allen Iverson thing." </span> What was done partially out of convenience was mistaken for a reflection of his character. A point that Iverson makes is that he was going to do what he wants to do, rather than trying to fit society's standards and look like someone else because that would not be staying true to Allen Iverson. </p>
      
      <p>Because of his image, Iverson believes that the news and media would rather only share stories that fit this image, further strengthening this false of persona of him as a thug. </p>

      <p> <span class="quote"> "The media will build you up just to knock you down. They'd rather see some negative happen with me than seeing me handing out turkeys or Christmas gifts or anything like that. That's not what people want to see. It's evil and it's wrong, but that's the world we live in." </span> </p>
      
      <p>Despite the criticism and poor publicity, Iverson remains confident and resilient. He is not bothered by it because he takes comfort in the fact that it comes from people who do not care about him anyways. He feels love from so many people- his friends, his family, and fans- so he does not see the point in concentrating on the negative things because it only wastes energy that he could be spending on the people and things that matter. </p>

      <p> However, Iverson admits that he wasn't always this strong. Rather, it was something he learned after enduring years of criticism, starting from a young age. <span class="quote2"> "I had to learn that. I had to realize and create rhino skin- thick skin. And at a young age it used to bother me. It used to actually hurt me... I had to learn the hard way that you're not going to satisfy everybody." </span></p>

      <p> He's not interested in proving to the world what type of person he truly is. As long as the people he loves and who love him know it, that's all that matters to him. He's okay with being a villain to the people that don't care about him, because he's a superhero to the ones who do. It's an Allen Iverson thing. </p>
