      <p><span class="quote">"We're at Oracle Arena, we had lost Game 1, and from a true basketball junkie- basketball nut- growing up and having watched all the superstar tapes and being with my dad in the driveway, and just being around the team and having the feeling and seeing the brotherhood and the family was something I really, really wanted to be a part of. But as things played out, Game 6, we ended up losing. I'm kind of standing up, everybody's going off the floor, and I'm looking down at the Golden State Warriors thinking, 'Okay. Okay. I know this feeling. I want to be back here.' "

        <p> Fresh off losing in the NBA championship series and now a free agent, Kevin Love had a difficult decision to make: stay in Cleveland to continue working towards what he initially came to do- win an NBA championship- or start over with another team. </p>
      <p>The then-26 year old walked away from millions and, what many people would describe as, a "dream job" in December of 2014 when the NBA season was getting into full swing. To no one's surprise, fans and media quickly questioned the reasons behind his mysterious and sudden disappearance. Sanders hopes to finally answer these questions. </p>
      <p> <span class="quote"> "Chase what you love, and everything you love will chase you right back." </span> </p>
      <p>In his mind, the time he needed to devote to his job as a professional basketball player was not worth sacrificing the other aspects of his life- his family, friends, personal interests- and his mental stability and happiness began to suffer because of it.  </p>
      <p> A major point that Larry Sanders wants people to remember is to be wary of assigning labels to people. There are many more dimenions to every individual than these labels will lead us to believe. <span class="quote2"> "Dont neglect the 'and..', that's what I always say. Don't neglect the 'and...'. You say I'm selfish, <b>and</b> I'm loving, <b>and</b> I'm caring, <b>and</b> I'm fearful sometimes. <b>And</b> I'm also brave. We are all more than just one thing."</span> People question how he cannot be happy with such a high paying, prolific job. But to Sanders, his happiness is not fueled by monetary wealth. Just because he is a professional basketball player, that does not mean his profession is his primary source of happiness. Individual happiness is definied within and is different for every person. Sanders' personal happiness comes from his closest loved ones and a sound mind. As Sanders argues, our ability to get though each day is heavily dependent on our mental health, and that is a part of us that we cannot forget to cater to.</p>

      <p>He is devoting his energy to spending times with friends and family, exploring personal interests such as music, and engaging in more positive pursuits. If and when he feels ready, he will consider a return to the NBA.</p>
