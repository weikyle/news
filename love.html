      <p><span class="quote">"We're at Oracle Arena, we had lost Game 1, and from a true basketball junkie- basketball nut- growing up and having watched all the superstar tapes and being with my dad in the driveway, and just being around the team and having the feeling and seeing the brotherhood and the family was something I really, really wanted to be a part of. But as things played out, Game 6, we ended up losing. I'm kind of standing up, everybody's going off the floor, and I'm looking down at the Golden State Warriors thinking, 'Okay. Okay. I know this feeling. I want to be back here.' "

        <p> Fresh off losing in the NBA championship series and now a free agent, Kevin Love had a difficult decision to make: stay in Cleveland to continue working towards what he initially came to do- win an NBA championship- or start over with another team. </p>
      <p>Kevin Love initially came to Cleveland two years ago to join forces with arguably the greatest basketball player on the planet at the time, Lebron James, and a young all-star who had already become of the best point guards in the game in Kyrie Irving, with the hopes of winning an NBA title. However, his reasons for staying in Cleveland went beyond that. <span class="quote2"> "Their fans are just so great, they're die-hard- as we like to say, they're all in. They love their athletes, they love their Cavaliers. It's a sports town." </span> He discovered that he loved the city and the atmosphere the fans provide, and he is now on the mission to bring a championship to a city that, he feels, greatly deserves one.</p>
      <p> <span class="quote"> "Chase what you love, and everything you love will chase you right back. That's happiness." </span> </p>

      <p>Love has found the brotherhood and the family that he has been searching for with the Cavaliers, and he has a found a city in Cleveland that he is comfortable in and that motivates him. Now he can focus on what has truly made him happy all along, his first true love: playing the game of basketball. </p>

      <p> For Love, the wounds from losing the NBA finals to the Golden State Warriors are still fresh. This has left him with a sense of unfinished business. He acknowledges that no one knows what the future holds in store for us, but he is happy with his decision to stay in Cleveland because it has allowed him to truly chase what he loves. </p>
